## [0.9.0] - 2024-10-14

### Fixed

* Ask for Pinocchio 3.0.0 (which exists, not 2.9.1)
* Fix use of installed jrl-cmakemodules ([#109](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite-nlp/pull/109))

### Changed

* Increase minimum version of eigenpy to 3.8.0
* [python] Header `proxsuite-nlp/python/deprecation-policy.hpp` is now deprecated and simply using-declares the templates from eigenpy's corresponding header (introduced in [3.6.0](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/eigenpy/releases/tag/v3.6.0))
* Rename the `ConstraintSetBase` template class to `ConstraintSetTpl`, add a deprecated typedef for compatibility
* Rename header `constraint-base.hpp` (and related files) to `constraint-set.hpp`, change former to a deprecated header `constraint-base.hpp`

## [0.8.0] - 2024-09-16

### Added

* Add compatibility with jrl-cmakemodules workspace ([#99](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite-nlp/pull/99))
* Add the `polymorphic_cxx14.hpp` header from [jbcoe/value_types](https://github.com/jbcoe/value_types/blob/main/polymorphic_cxx14.h), [#90](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite-nlp/pull/90)
* **Python:** add conversions (for values, versions) for the `polymorphic<T,A>` types in new `<proxsuite-nlp/python/polymorphic.hpp>` header
* **Python:** add `PolymorphicVisitor` visitor and `register_polymorphic_to_python<T>()` template function to register conversions from/to the `polymorphic<T, A>` type
* Allow use of installed jrl-cmakemodules & eigenrand ([#106](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite-nlp/pull/106))

### Changed

* Change from `shared_ptr<T>` to `polymorphic<T>` for manifolds and constraint sets
* Remove use of `std::make_shared` for manifolds in examples [#90](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite-nlp/pull/90), instead plass pain types
* `ConstraintObjectTpl` now holds the constraint set through a `polymorphic<ConstraintSet>`
* Changed ctors of `ProblemTpl` and `CostAbstractTpl` to template which takes the concrete manifold type
* **Python:** pull all wrapper classes (inheriting from `bp::wrapper<U>`) out of the `aligator::python::internal` namespace
* **Python:** fix abstract classes exposed as subclasses of `bp::wrapper<U>` not registering their owning `PyObject*` properly
* Removed function template `allocate_shared_eigen_aligned` since we now use C++17 and Eigen::aligned_allocator is no longer needed.
* Remove redundant macro `PROXSUITE_NLP_DEFINE_MANIFOLD_TYPES` and `PointType/TangentVectorType` typedefs in manifold API
